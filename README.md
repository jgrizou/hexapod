# Hexapod

Together with [JÃ©rome Bechu](http://jerome.bechu.org/) we have been prototyping a hexapod robot. Each leg has 3 degrees of freedom and is made of simple metal part with rather cheap, but really strong, [servomotors](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__9617__Turnigy_Metal_Gear_Servo_60g_15_5kg_16sec.html). We redesigned, and 3D printed, the back part of the servomotors in order to have an axis on both sides.
